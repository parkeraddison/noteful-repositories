## Motivation

Personal development notes are crucial for truly understanding how a code repository ended up where it is now. The key directions that the developer had in mind, the approaches they took, and the problems they ran into and tackled or worked around are all things that show up in personal notes, but often don't work their way into a distilled README or technical comments.

It's time we change that, and start shedding more light into the thoughts that contribute to developing a repository. Repositories should be noteful!
